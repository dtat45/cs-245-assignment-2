--------- Question 1 ---------

The driver function reads the config files and stores related information (store, store file, delivery fees) into Lists. 
After the List are initialized, the user is prompted to enter their desired item, the size of the item, and the quantity
desired. If the item and size finds a match in a service's inventory, the cost of the item is added to the total
cost, with respect to that service, and the user is prompted to add another item. The requested item is 
searched for in each service. If no service contains the requested item in their inventory, the user is 
also prompted to enter a new item. If the user enters 'done', choosing not to enter another item, the service
that contains all requested items and has the cheapest cost will be displayed, along with the total cost.

--------- Question 2 ---------

This implementation of the ALaCarte assignment integrates the List interface. This class stores the services, the name of their inventory 
file, and total cost in a List. The services List ('storeList') holds the names of each service to be referenced when the user is finished
shopping. The inventory file List ('storeFiles') holds the file names of each service to be referenced when checking if the requested item 
is found in the service's inventory. The total cost List ('totalCosts') is used to keep track of the total cost of the user's request items.
Additionally, it contains a boolean List ('hasAllItems') that is used to check if each service's inventory contains all the requested items.
